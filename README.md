# Epics and Qt resource links

Two formats of a single document are provided: .odt and .pdf

This document contains three lists of links.

	- A list of links to official documents and guides concerning Epics
	version 3 and version 4.

	- A list of links to official documents and guides concerning Qt. 
	Specifically Qt 4.8.

	- A list of links to projects in a public github repo. These are 
	unofficial and were written by an intern at the SNS c. summer of 2017.
	They are not guaranteed to work or be indicative of best practices
	but do serve as simple examples for Epics version 4 and Qt.
